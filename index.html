        <div id="whatuwuheader">What is UWU?</div>
        <div id="square1"></div>
    <hwhat><span id="whatisuwutextuwu">uwu</span> is an emoticon that can be pronounced by the way it is spelled 
        (“OO-WOO”). It is an expression of a smiley face that denotes cuteness and 
        can largely be found on the internet, characterized by a<span id="awu">u, w,</span> and a <span id="awu">u</span> placed 
        next to each other to cutesify a sentence. The expression itself is meant to be: 
        <span id="happiinsmug">‘happy in a smug kind of way’</span>.
<br>
<br>
        uwu does not stand for anything, but can be used to help express a particularly cutesy 
        and/or childish way of talking. Like how uwu can express happy emotions, it can also
         express a condescending tone, an ironic cool demeanor, or be used as conversation filler 
         in text when someone has nothing to say back (similar to how we use lol and lmfao today).

However, that in itself is just how uwu is used in its text format. uwu is very, very versatile in 
text and is used frequently in meme culture. From social media to texting to online aesthetics, 
uwu is everywhere.<br>

        <div id="whereisuwuusedheader">Where is UWU used?</div>
        <br>
        <hwhere><span id="whereisuwutextuwu">uwu</span> largely lives on the internet, but I have no doubt 
            that there are people in real life who 
            use uwu unironically and probably say it out loud lol.

            uwu is used frequently in the furry community as well, l
            argely due to their beleif that the ‘w’ in uwu shares a likeness 
            to an anthropormorphic snout.
            <br>
            <div id="uwugif2where"><img src="uwu-gif2.gif" alt="uwugif2where" width=20% height=20%></div>
            
            There is no exact way to use uwu. Like a lot of internet culture, 
            phrases and words taken from there have largely different meanings 
            today compared to how they were used in the past. The uwus of back then were probably 
            not used in the same way like the uwus of today. And remember, remember, uwu is a tool that people 
            use to help express themselves. Therefore, the meaning of uwu will change depending on who is using 
            it and what they are using it for. uwu, ultimately, is a tool for self-expression, and what people
             choose to do with such a tool is up to them.

             <br>
             <br>
             <br>
            For example: On May 12th, 2013, a conversation about uwu went viral on Tumblr. 
            [12] In the post, User homuras says, “‘uwu’ isnt even a face to me anymore its actually 
            the sound ‘oowoo.’” strudelgit responds with, “IT’S SUPPOSED TO BE A FACE!?!??!”, showing the generational 
            gap between individuals on the internet.
            <div id="tumblrface"><img src="supposed-to-be-face-uwu.png" alt="tumblrface"></div>
            
            From there, image edits that used the emoticon grew in popularity in the 2010s. 
            On July 20th, 2015, akoolguy created an edit of the Wii that features uwu. 
            The post received more than 55,000 notes in less than six years.
            <div id="akoolguy"><img src="wii-akoolguy.png" alt="akoolguy"></div>
            uwu is not meant to be mistaken for owo (also used in the furry community), which is a 
            branching expression of o.o, which is an emoticon meant to show surprise and confusion 
            <div id="owouwugif"><img src="owo-uwu.gif" alt="owouwugif" width=20% height=20%></div>

            <br>
            <br>
            <horigin>No one is sure about the exact origins of <span id="originsofuwutextuwu">uwu</span>.

                Some say it originated in online chatrooms, with its first appearance being in a Yu-Gi-Oh fanfiction, 
                Genie of the Puzzle, published by user DaakuKitsune on October 14th, 2005. In the author's
                notes before the story, the author states<br><br> <span id="fanfictext">“Again, feel free to throw squids and fish at me. 
                UwU I deserve it, you know”</span>.

                <div id="fanficuwu"><img src="fanfic-uwu.png" alt="fanficuwu"></div>
                <br>
                Others say it originated from Japanese anime culture, where it was influenced by the 
                ‘kawaii’ face made by anime characters - which, considering the likeness, is probably true.
                <div id="slyanimegirl2"><img src="sly-anime-uwu.gif" alt="slyanimegirl2" width=100% height=100%></div>

                But one thing is for certain, like many internet trends, once tumblr picked it up, uwu’s
                 destiny was set in stone.</horigin>

                <br>
                <br>
                <hproblem>Of course, there are downsides to every internet trend. <span id="problematicuwutext">uwu</span> is not exempt from 
                    being associated with some questionable behaviors, no matter how cute.

                    People on the internet raised concerns that usage of uwu in addition to using ‘kawaii’ 
                    mannerisms would be weaponized by older men looking to catfish and take advantage of 
                    young people on the internet by using this to seem more approachable and younger, 
                    posing a danger to others.
                    <br>
                    The aesthetic, uwu girl trend, relies on the image of the hyper-feminine gamer girl persona. 
                    As stated by Ashley Bardhan in Input, who has interviewed several female discord gamers who 
                    adopt the uwu girl aesthetic as a way to gain access into a field that is highly male dominated, 

                    “uwu girl” “is a girl who brings the emoticon to life through her aesthetic and her demeanor, which tends to be 
                    sweetly childlike, but also suggestive, drawing on the sexualization of (usually young) anime girls. The aesthetic 
                    involves lots and lots of pink and cutesifying of self through makeup that prioritizes unnaturally big eyes and fake 
                    freckles, invoking cartoon characters like Sailor Moon and the concept of the hyperfeminine gamer girl. 
                    <div id="uwugirlaesthetic"><img src="uwu-girl-sigh.jpeg" alt="uwugirlaesthetic" height=60% width=60%></div>
                    Not to be confused with “softgirls,” who also like pink but don’t play video games (think queen of doing that “sexy baby” thing, 
                    Ariana Grande), or “egirls,” who play video games and like anime, but prefer black fishnets and chokers to an uwu girl’s 
                    pink miniskirt.”

                    While it is okay to embody the fashion of an aesthetic, these traits of 
                    childlike behavior associated with anime girls that these people are 
                    basing their personas off of to an audience who is most likely going to 
                    going fetishize them are also demeaning and play off of, no matter how
                     unintentional, the submissive Asian woman trope - who must be hyperfeminine, 
                     youthful and childlike, dependent, but also unintentionally sexy. This is 
                     not meant to imply that uwu is the sole cause of this, nor is it meant to imply 
                     that uwu is something that came directly from Japanese culture - as the origins of 
                     uwu are rather blurry and honestly probably moreso a constantly changing product of the 
                     internet - depending on the social media landscape - but, it does play a role in many weeb
                      circles, is used in the e-girl trend, and contributes to the overall ‘anime girl aesthetic’
                       - which originated from Japanese anime culture - which contributes to the commodification 
                       of such traits, especially when the uwu and/or E-girl persona is being performed by non-Asian
                        people. And, it is literally called the ‘uwu girl aesthetic’.
                        <div id="egirlsigh1"><img src="e-girl-sigh.jpeg" alt="egirlsigh1" height=60% width=60%></div>
                        <div id="egirlsigh2"><img src="egirl-sigh2.jpeg" alt="egirlsigh2" height=60% width=60%></div>

                    Also, differing from the UWU girls of discord, the E-girls of tiktok take their look 
                    from Japanese Harajuku fashion, which is based on gothic-influenced and cosplay-style
                     clothing. Many individuals believe that this fashion emerged on tiktok, which, it did
                      not. UWU plays into this because it is frequently used by this community of people 
                      and perpetuates a persona of a cute, childlike behavior reminiscient of submissive 
                      asian female stereotypes. There is nothing wrong with liking Harajuku fashion or
                       the e-girl aesthetic, but the behavior that is attributed to this is demeaning - 
                       especially when non-Asian streamers and tiktokers in this community profit off 
                       of their audience fetishizing them like how poeple fetishize Asian women, 
                       which normalizes racist and sexist behaviors.
